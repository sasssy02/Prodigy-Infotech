Task-3: Develop a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based 
on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset like the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning 
Repository.

Customer Purchase Prediction Using Decision Tree Classifier
This Python script builds a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase behavior using the Bank Marketing dataset.
The script utilizes pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for building and evaluating the model, and matplotlib for visualizing
the decision tree. It begins with data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, 
and splitting the data into training and test sets. The decision tree model is trained to classify whether a customer
will purchase a product based on variables like age, job type, marital status, education level, and previous campaign interactions.
Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated, and the decision tree is visualized to understand the decision paths. 
This script is a practical tool for marketing analysis and can be adapted for similar datasets to predict customer behavior.
