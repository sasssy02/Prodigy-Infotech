Task-2: Conduct data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a chosen dataset, such as the Titanic dataset 
from Kaggle. Examine relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends.

Titanic Dataset EDA and Data Cleaning
This Python script performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. 
Using pandas for data manipulation, seaborn for visualization, and matplotlib for plotting, the script handles missing values, 
encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical data. It provides insights into passenger demographics, survival rates, 
and other factors like class, gender, and age. Visualizations such as heatmaps, bar charts, and pair plots are used to explore correlations
and uncover patterns in the data. This analysis offers a comprehensive view of the dataset and is adaptable for other datasets to identify trends and relationships.
