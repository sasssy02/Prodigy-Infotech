Task-5: Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.
Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

Traffic Accident Data Analysis and Visualization
This Python script analyzes traffic accident data to uncover patterns associated with road conditions, weather, 
and time of day. Utilizing pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical analysis, and matplotlib and seaborn 
for visualization, the script processes a dataset containing detailed records of traffic accidents. It performs data cleaning,
including handling missing values and categorizing variables related to road conditions (wet, dry), weather (clear, rainy, foggy),
and time of day (morning, afternoon, night).

The analysis identifies trends and correlations among these factors, allowing for the visualization of accident 
hotspots using heatmaps and geographic plots. The script also generates bar charts and line graphs to showcase
the frequency of accidents in relation to different weather conditions and times of day. This comprehensive analysis
provides valuable insights for traffic safety improvements and can be adapted for other datasets to enhance understanding 
of accident causes and prevention strategies.
