Task-1: 

Develop a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as age or gender distribution within a population.
Population Age Distribution Visualization
This Python script creates a bar chart to illustrate the age distribution within a population using data from an Excel file. It leverages pandas for data manipulation,
matplotlib for visualization, and numpy for numerical operations. The script processes the Excel file, manages missing data, calculates median ages, and plots the bar chart. 
The visualization highlights age categories (0-14, 15-64, 65+) and offers insights into their distribution. It is suitable for demographic analysis and can be modified for 
different population datasets.
