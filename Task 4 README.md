Task-4: Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion 
and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

Social Media Sentiment Analysis and Visualization
This Python script conducts sentiment analysis on social media data to explore public opinions and attitudes 
toward a particular topic or brand. Using libraries such as pandas for data handling, NLTK and TextBlob for sentiment
analysis, and matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations, the script processes a dataset containing social media posts.
It cleans the text data by removing noise (hashtags, mentions, URLs) and performs sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral). 
The results are visualized through bar charts, word clouds, and time series plots, showing sentiment distribution
and trends over time. This analysis provides insights into public sentiment patterns and can be tailored to other
datasets or topics to evaluate brand perception or public opinion effectively.
